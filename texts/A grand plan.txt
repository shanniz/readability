A grand plan. 
Let us catch this ball.
This is not fun at all.
Let us catch a fish at that shack.
I can not walk to the shack and back.
Let us call Brad and Jim and talk with them.
That is not my plan.
Let us pick up the trash on the path. That plan is good!
This statement has never been seen before.
